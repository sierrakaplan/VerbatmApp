1. Photos, Videos, or Text (PVT) that introduces you and the event you're going to. Talk a little about how you feel about the event (excited, interested, etc.) \n \
2. PVT that gives the viewer a sense of the event--cool moments and your reaction to them. \n \
3. PVT that summarizes what you want people to know about the event, and what your main takeaway has been from attending. \
