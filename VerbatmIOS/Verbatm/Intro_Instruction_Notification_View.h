/*
 Used to present the three intro instructions FEED/ADK/Profile
 Just pass the screen center and a type
 And the view will manage the rest -- note that the view will
 notify the delegate (should be the superview) when it is done and 
 faded out so that it's removed from it's superview;
 
 We expect that new view is created per notification -- not to be recycled
