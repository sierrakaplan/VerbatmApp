//	This class was created for Matter Demo Day, to store user posts locally.
//	It can be used to store a user post consisting of a pinch views and a channel (thread) name
//	in the user defaults, in order to display a post stored locally. It is hacky not production level code.
//	It remains around for test purposes only.
