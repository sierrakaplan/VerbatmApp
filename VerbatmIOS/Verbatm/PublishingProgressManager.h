/*
 Manages the publishing of content (by starting the parse domino effect)
 but is mainly used to track progress and to notify relevant ui. Because you can
 only publish one post at a time and because we only have one publishing UI bar
 we simply rely on a delegate to communite progress completion.
 You track the NSProgress Accountant to see how far we're progressing with media saving.
